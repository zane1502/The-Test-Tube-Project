THE TEST TUBE PROJECT:


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Test Tube Project is a campus-focused payment and financial insights platform designed to make Web3 simple, relatable,
and useful for African students. By combining Solana Pay’s lightning-fast blockchain network with AI-driven natural 
language insights, Test Tube allows students to make seamless payments while also gaining clear, 
actionable understanding of their finances.

Students can pay merchants on campus using Solana Pay QR codes, with each transaction enriched by metadata such as 
purpose and timestamp. An AI layer then translates this blockchain data into plain-language insights like... 
“You spent 2 SOL on transport today” or “Your data expenses may affect your feeding budget.” 
Traditional analytics—charts, reports, and Excel exports—make it even easier to budget and track spending.

To ensure real adoption, Test Tube hopes to integrate with the cNGN stablecoin, allowing campus merchants to 
receive payments directly in Naira while still benefiting from the transparency and speed of blockchain.

In essence, Test Tube:

1. Promotes inclusion by stripping away Web3 jargon and making crypto accessible.

2. Facilitates reliable payments with Solana Pay.

3. Empowers students with AI-powered financial literacy and analytics.

The project aims to us Nigerian university campuses as experimental “test tubes” to validate the feasibility of 
blockchain + AI payments in real communities, with the long-term goal of scaling to Africa and beyond.
